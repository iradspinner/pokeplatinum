# Save layout: what Platinum Oxide moved, and why

Phase 4 breaks save compatibility with vanilla Platinum. Ian confirmed that is
acceptable (`phase4-engine-change-answers.md`, question 7), and PKHeX
compatibility is not a goal. This file is the running record of every field
that moved, so the damage is known rather than discovered.

**A save made before a change on this list will not read correctly after it.**

## Boxed Pokemon, block A and block B (2026-09-20)

A boxed Pokemon is four 32-byte blocks, shuffled by personality and encrypted.
Block A was full: it ends with `ribbonsDS1`, a u32 at 0x1C, so there was no
room to widen anything in it. Block B had three spare bytes, `unused1` at 0x19
and `unused2` at 0x1A.

| Field | Was | Is | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| ability | block A 0x0D, u8 | block B 0x1A, u16 | hg-engine's ability ids run past 255 and the donor ROM stores them two bytes wide |

Consequences:

- Block A 0x0D is now `unusedAbility` and is never read or written.
- Block B's `unused2` is gone; the `MON_DATA_UNUSED_114` parameter that was the
  only way to reach it has had its accessor cases removed. The enum member is
  left in place so no other parameter's value shifts.
- **On an old save every Pokemon's ability reads as ABILITY_NONE**, because
  block B's spare u16 was zero. `BoxPokemon_CalcAbility` runs on level-up and
  evolution, so a party would partly heal itself over time, but a battle before
  that would be played with no abilities at all. Start a new game.
- `UnkStruct_02078B40`, which mirrors block A for the party-summary path,
  carries the ability as a u16 too.
- Block B's `unused1` (0x19, HGSS shiny leaves) is still free.

## Species records, `pl_personal.narc` (2026-09-20)

Not save data, but it is the other format that moved and the two are usually
changed together.

| Field | Was | Is | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| abilities | offset 22, `u8[2]` | offset 22, `u16[3]` | u16 ids, plus a third slot for the hidden ability |

The record grows from 44 bytes to 48. Everything after the abilities shifts by
four: `safariFleeRate` 24 to 28, the body-colour and flip-sprite byte 25 to 29,
the TM learnset masks 28 to 32. The two padding bytes stay where they were
relative to the masks.

`verify_narcs.py` can no longer compare `pl_personal.narc` against the base ROM
member for member. The check that replaced it, run once when the change was
made, reads the base ROM with the four-byte shift applied and confirms all 508
records still agree field for field. Rerun it if the record moves again.

## Not yet moved, but expected to

Listed so the next change can be planned rather than discovered:

- Species ids past 493, which widens every species-indexed table and the dex
  flags in the save (Phase 4 element 3)
- 30 PC boxes (Phase 4 element 8)
- Move ids past 511 in level-up learnsets, which changes the learnset entry
  from one packed u16 to a (u16 level, u16 move) pair (Phase 4 element 4)
- The expanded bag, if the item pass outgrows Platinum's free item slots
  (Phase 4 element 7)
